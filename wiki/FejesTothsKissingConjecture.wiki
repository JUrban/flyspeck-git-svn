#summary Fejes Toth's Conjecture on Packings with Kissing Number Twelve

= Introduction =

Here are computer resources that are used in the verification of Fejes Toth's Conjecture
on Packings with Kissing Number Twelve.
The conjecture, which was made in 1969, states:

"In 3-space any
packing of equal balls such that each ball is touched by twelve others
consists of hexagonal layers.''

This conjecture has been verified in the preprint "A Proof of Fejes Toth's  Conjecture on Sphere Packings with
Kissing Number Twelve" by Thomas Hales.


= Details =

The calculation of constants in Mathematica {{{HFBBNUL}}} and {{{6621965370}}}.
This relies on initialization file [http://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmathematica/sphere.m sphere.m] and the notebook [http://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmathematica/FejesTothKissingConjecture FejesTothKissingConjecture]

There is also graph generation {{{PYWHMHQ}}}.  This is run with the flyspeck project loaded and
executing the commands:
{{{
flyspeck_needs ("/../graph_generator/graph_control.hl");;
Graph_control.run(Graph_control.fejes_toth_contact_conjecture_properties);;
}}}

Finally, there are some linear programs {{{JKJNYAA}}}.  This is executed with the flyspeck project loaded and executing the commands:
{{{
flyspeck_needs "../glpk/glpk_link.ml";;
flyspeck_needs ("../glpk/fejestoth_contact/lipstick_ft.ml");;
Lipstick_ft.exec();;
}}}
