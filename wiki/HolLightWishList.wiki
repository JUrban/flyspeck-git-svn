#summary Features hoped for in a future release of Hol Light

= Wish List =

 * Write {{{( * )}}} for infix multiplication rather than {{{(*)}}} because the latter confuses emacs syntacs highlighting.  (It interprets it as a ML comment.)
 * In analysis.ml, a restrictive skeleton excludes many useful sums and breaks the "search" function when searching for theorems with "sum".  Write the skeleton as {{{make_overloadable "sum" `:A->(B->real)->real`;;}}}
 * There does not seem to exist an order in which to load the files that allows one to load vectors.ml, analysis.ml, transc.ml, and convex.ml
