#summary Features hoped for in a future release of Hol Light

= Wish List =

 * Write {{{( * )}}} for infix multiplication rather than {{{(*)}}} because the latter confuses emacs syntacs highlighting.  (It interprets it as a ML comment.)
 * In analysis.ml, a restrictive skeleton excludes many useful sums and breaks the "search" function when searching for theorems with "sum".  Write the skeleton as {{{make_overloadable "sum" `:A->(B->real)->real`;;}}}
 * Aug 24 2009 snapshot of HOL Light seems incompatible with Examples/products.ml when running in ocaml 3.10.
