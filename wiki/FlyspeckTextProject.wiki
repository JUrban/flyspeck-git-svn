#summary Text Formalization Projects needed for completion of Flyspeck

= Guidelines =
  * Do not ever introduce new axioms.  If you need results from earlier chapters that have not been proved, introduce them as explicit assumptions in the statement of the theorem.  If there are assumptions you use more than once, make a definition containing the term, so that you can just type {{{my_assumption}}} for example, to enter it as an assumption.  You are not allowed to use assumptions to make the theorem easier to prove.  Only use assumptions for lemmas from earlier chapters that have not been proved yet.
  * Package the results up when you are done, using {{{THEN}}} and {{{THENL}}}.

  * rogers partition (Nguyen Tat Thang, John Harrison)
  * marchal's partition (John Harrison)
  * kissing number estimates (function M) (John Harrison)
  * more kissing number estimates (function L) (John Harrison)

= Tame hypermap =
  * contravention is tame  
    *  Definition of tame
    *  /PPHEUFG/ A hypermap is tame if and only if its opposite is tame. (Trieu Thi Diep)
    *  /FATUGPD/ /FNJLBXS/ /FCDJDOT/  A counterexample can be "improved" by moving spheres inward.   (Vu Khac Ky FATUGPD) (Vuong Anh Quyen FNJLBXS)
    *  /HRXEFDM/ The definition of tau and the equivalence of a tau-bound with the L-bound. (Vu Van Phan)

    *  /CRTTXAT/ every face has cardinality at most 6.  (Dang Tat Dat)
    *  triangles condition of tameness
  * main estimate 

= Special Projects =
    * Project management software (Nguyen Duc Tam)

= Lemmas in Elementary Geometry =

  * Nguyen Quang Truong has completed proofs of many results in this collection.  These results need to be integrated with the 2009 version of the proof.
    * positive orientation "chi", delta properties, E, quad interior.

= Supplementary results = 

  * circular disks and polyhedra
  * deformations of polygons for the main estimate.

= Packaging = 

  * moving the project over to Multivariate library.
  * no new axioms
  * all theorems properly packaged

= nonlinear inequalities (contact Roland) = 

There are many [NonlinearInequalities] that occur in the proof.  The list is much shorter in the 2009 proof.  The list requires formal verification.

= linear programming = 

(Matthew Wampler-Doty, Nguyen Duc Thinh)

The linear programming part of the proof is given in [http://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/source/browse/#svn/trunk/glpk ocaml linear programming].  This piece of code requires formalization.  Steven Obua has an Isabelle implementation of linear programming.  He has used it to treat over 90% of the cases that arise in the original 1998 proof of the Kepler conjecture.  His work needs to be adapted to the 2009 proof.  Matthew Wampler-Doty has been involved in this project during the summer 2009.



= graph generator (completed by Bauer-Nipkow) = 

Bauer and Nipkow have a formal correctness proof of the graph generator in Isabelle.
The graph generator uses a different set of input parameters in the 1998 and 2009 proofs.  The Bauer-Nipkow
result needs to be adapted to the new set of input parameters.

Roughly, the Bauer-Nipkow result assumes an algorithm for generating restricted hypermaps and based on that, they give a
correctness proof that the computer code correctly filters the tame hypermaps.  The chapter on hypermap gives an algorithm for generating restricted hypermaps.  This should be combined with the Bauer-Nipkow result.
