  * topology: Hoang Le Truong
  * planarity
  * proof of face attributes
  * polygon perimeter
  * polygon area (unwritten text)

  * rogers partition (J.H.)
  * marchal's partition (J.H.)
  * kissing number estimates (function M) (J.H.)
  * more kissing number estimates (function L) (J.H.)

= Tame hypermap =
  * contravention is tame  (There are 13 lemmas here to be done.)
    *  Definition of tame
    *  /PPHEUFG/ A hypermap is tame if and only if its opposite is tame.
    *  /FATUGPD/ /FNJLBXS/ /FCDJDOT/  A counterexample can be "improved" by moving spheres inward.
    *  /HRXEFDM/ The definition of tau and the equivalence of a tau-bound with the L-bound.
    *  /CDTETAT/, /SZIPOAS/, /KCBLRQC/, /BDJYFFB/ linear programming properties of nodes.
    *  /CRTTXAT/ every face has cardinality at most 6.
    *  /GNCEGFN/ four-face-step lemma (assuming the result about packings in Elementary Geometry).
    *  triangles condition of tameness
  * main estimate (Thomas Hales)

= Lemmas in Elementary Geometry =
  * Nguyen Quang Truong has completed proofs of many results in this collection.  These results need to be integrated with the 2009 version of the proof.
    * 

= Supplementary results = 

  * moving the project over to Multivariate library.
  * no new axioms
  * all theorems properly packaged
  * A quadrilateral face of a tame graph does not contain two interior vertices.
  * polar polygons
  * circular disks and polyhedra
  * Jordan curve type results.

= nonlinear inequalities (contact Roland) = 

There are many [NonlinearInequalities] that occur in the proof.  The list is much shorter in the 2009 proof.  The list requires formal verification.

= linear programming = 

The linear programming part of the proof is given in [http://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/source/browse/#svn/trunk/glpk ocaml linear programming].  This piece of code requires formalization.  Steven Obua has an Isabelle implementation of linear programming.  He has used it to treat over 90% of the cases that arise in the original 1998 proof of the Kepler conjecture.  His work needs to be adapted to the 2009 proof.  Matthew Wampler-Doty has been involved in this project during the summer 2009.

= graph generator (completed by Bauer-Nipkow) = 

Bauer and Nipkow have a formal correctness proof of the graph generator in Isabelle.
The graph generator uses a different set of input parameters in the 1998 and 2009 proofs.  The Bauer-Nipkow
result needs to be adapted to the new set of input parameters.

Roughly, the Bauer-Nipkow result assumes an algorithm for generating restricted hypermaps and based on that, they give a
correctness proof that the computer code correctly filters the tame hypermaps.  The chapter on hypermap gives an algorithm for generating restricted hypermaps.  This should be combined with the Bauer-Nipkow result.
