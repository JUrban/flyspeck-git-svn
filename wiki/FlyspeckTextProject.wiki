#summary Text Formalization Projects needed for completion of Flyspeck

= Trig Chapter = 
  * John Harrison (arg, azim)
  * Jason Rute,
  * Nguyen Quang Truong, work in progress

= Volume Chapter =
  * construction of measure: John Harrison (done)
  * primitive volumes: John Harrison (done)
  * solid angle, finiteness bounds: Nguyen Tat Thang (work in progress)

= Hypermap Chapter =
  * Tran Nam Trung, work in progress

= Fan Chapter =
  * topology: Hoang Le Truong
  * planarity
  * proof of face attributes
  * polygon perimeter
  * polygon area (unwritten text)
  * polyhedron: John Harrison has formalized the Krein-Milman theorem

= Formulation = 
  * statement: 
  * rogers partition: 
  * marchal's partition
  * kissing number estimates (function M)
  * more kissing number estimates (function L)
  * bounding the number of spheres

= Tame hypermap =
  * contravention is tame
  * main estimate (Thomas Hales)
  * main estimate cases (Thomas Hales)

= Lemmas in Elementary Geometry =
  * Nguyen Quang Truong has completed proofs of many results in this collection.  These results need to be integrated with the 2009 version of the proof.

= Supplementary results = 

  * moving the project over to Multivariate library.
  * no new axioms
  * all theorems properly packaged
  * A quadrilateral face of a tame graph does not contain two interior vertices.
  * polar polygons
  * circular disks and polyhedra
  * Jordan curve type results.

= nonlinear inequalities (contact Roland) = 

There are many [NonlinearInequalities] that occur in the proof.

= linear programming = 

The linear programming part of the proof is given in [http://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/source/browse/#svn/trunk/glpk ocaml linear programming].  This piece of code requires formalization.  Steven Obua has an Isabelle implementation of linear programming.  He has used it to treat over 90% of the cases that arise in the original 1998 proof of the Kepler conjecture.  His work needs to be adapted to the 2009 proof.  Matthew Wampler-Doty has been involved in this project during the summer 2009.

= graph generator (completed by Bauer-Nipkow) =
