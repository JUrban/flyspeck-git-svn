#this page gives a summary of the use of non-linear inequalities in the proof.
= Introduction =

This page gives the nonlinear inequalities used in the proof of the Kepler Conjecture (2009 version).  This is recent research and many of the inequalities have not been verified by interval arithmetic.  We mark each inequality FP (formal proof completed), VE (verified by ordinary interval arithmetic), or NV (not verified), depending on its status.

= Minor inequalities = 

 * An inequality approximating arc (cc:arc in tex files).  {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * The disjointness of Marchal's disks (cc:disks in tex files). a + a' <= arc(2h,2h',2). {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * A linear lower bound on the area of regular polygons (cc:alin in tex). We may replace n with a continuous variable n>=3.  The inequality can be cut off for some large n, because the partial derivative in n has fixed sign for large n.  {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * A linear lower bound on the area of regular polygons (large disk) (cc:alin2 in tex). {{{STATUS_NV}}}

= Inequalities from Marchal's paper =

 * Marchal's k-cell inequality {{{gamma(X,M)}}} is non-negative. (cc:mar in tex files) {{{STATUS_NV}}}

= Supercell Inequalities =

 * /GLFVCVK/ gamma2 is nonnegative on non-quarters. (cc:qtr in tex) {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * /FHBVYXZ/ 2-blade inequality: gamma2(four-cell)+gamma2(three-cell) >= 0.   (cc:2bl in tex) {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * /BIXPCGW/ 3-blade inequalities:  (cc:3bl in tex) {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * 4-blade inequalities:  (cc:4bl in tex) {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * /ZTGIJCF/ 5-blade inequalities:  (cc:5bl in tex) {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * /TTAMHQQ/ 6 or more-blade inequalities:  (cc:6bl in tex) {{{STATUS_NV}}}

= Tau Estimates =
 * The second derivatives are negative, allowing heights to be adjusted (cc:d2a, cc:d2b in tex files).  {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * A quadrilateral can be deformed (cc:qua in tex files) {{{STATUS_NV}}}
 * Tau estimates for each partition (cc:tau in tex files) {{{STATUS_NV}}}

= Minor Linear programs =

 * /FUSDSPJ/  Tameness constants b(p,q).  There is a collection of inequalities for triangles and quadrilaterals relating tau and azim.   This includes dihedral angle bounds for triangles, quadrilaterals and exceptional regions.  {{{STATUS_NV}}}
