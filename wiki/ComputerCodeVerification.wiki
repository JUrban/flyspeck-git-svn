#summary What's left of the computer code verification

= Introduction =

There are three pieces of computer code in the proof of the Kepler conjecture.  They are

 # Hypermap generator
 # Linear programming
 # Nonlinear multivariate inequalities

The status of the formal verification of these programs is discussed on this page.

The primary contributors to the computer code verification have been

 * G. Bauer
 * T. Nipkow
 * A. Solovyev

= Status of the Linear Programming code verification project = 

 A. Solovyev has built extremely efficient tools for the verification of linear programs
inside HOL Light.  It is capable of making a formal verification of a large-scale linear
program in a matter of seconds.

To complete this part of the project, it is still necessary to run about 50K linear programs
through Solovyev's verification machine.  Some theorems need to be proved in HOL Light
related to the subdivision of hypermaps and related facts that come up in the branch and
bound process of the linear programming verification.

== Integration with Text ==

The text formalization part of the Kepler conjecture excludes the Main Estimate Section of the
Local Fan Chapter.  This section contains the following lemmas that need formal verification.
