= The Fine Print =

 * The 32 pages does not include the parts of the text (such as remarks, introductory passages, and auxiliary results)  that are not strictly a  part of the proof of the Kepler conjecture.
 * It does not include the parts of the Kepler conjecture that lie outside the text.  That is, it does not include the computer portions of the proof.
 * Also excluded are three specific sections of the text that talk about the relationship between the text and the computer portions of the proof.
